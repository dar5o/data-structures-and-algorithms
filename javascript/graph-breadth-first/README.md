# Breadth First Traversal

## Challenge
Write a function that can perform breadth first traversal

## FeaturesS
- breadth first
- Arguments: Node
- Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
- Display the collection

## Algorithm
- initialize queue
- mark first vertex as visited
- go to each adjacent vertex and mark them as visited
- add vertex to queue
- repeat until queue is empty and each node has been visited
