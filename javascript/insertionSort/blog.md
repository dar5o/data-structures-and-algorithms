# Insertion Sort

##### Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds a final array one step at a time. Think of it as sorting cards in your hand.

You pass through the array once and look to see if there is a number less than the numbher at index 0. If the key element is greater than the element before it, compare it to all elements after it. You will then move the lesser elements one position down to make space for the swapped element.

Since this array is being sorted in place, it keeps the space at constant O(1)
