# Trees

## Problem Domain

### Challenge 15

Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
- pre order
- in order
- post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
Add- Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains- Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

### Challenge 16

Find the maximum value in a binary tree

## Challenge 18

Write a function called fizz buzz tree
Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String

- Arguments: k-ary tree

- Return: new k-ary tree
